# Decidim installation script 

For Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and macos sierra 10.2.

This is a BETA and as such you should be aware that this could break your environment (if you have any)

This will install rbenv, postgresql, nodejs and install decidim on this directory

It should take 15 minutes depending on your network connection.

```
$ wget http://get.decidim.org -O install_decidim.bash
$ bash install_decidim.bash 
```
